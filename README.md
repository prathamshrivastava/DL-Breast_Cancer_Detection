# Breast Cancer Detection using Deep Learning 🧠🔬

This project applies deep learning techniques to detect breast cancer using medical diagnostic data. The goal is to build a model that classifies tumors as **benign** or **malignant**, aiding early diagnosis and treatment.

## 📌 Overview

- Built using Python and Google Colab
- Trained a neural network on breast cancer dataset
- Evaluated model performance using accuracy, precision, recall, and confusion matrix
- Visualized results for better interpretability

## 🧰 Technologies Used

- Python 🐍
- TensorFlow / Keras
- Pandas & NumPy
- Matplotlib & Seaborn
- Scikit-learn

## 🚀 How to Run

1. Open the Colab notebook in this repo
2. Run all cells step by step
3. Model will train and evaluate results automatically

## 📝 Results

- Achieved high classification accuracy upto 96%
- Visualized training metrics and confusion matrix
- Model can assist in basic tumor classification tasks
